/*

The address payable type in Solidity is used to represent Ethereum addresses that you want to send Ether to.
Metaphor
Imagine a shopping mall with two kinds of stores: showrooms where you cannot make purchases and fully plugged stores where you can see and buy.
●
Regular address: This is like a showroom where you could see but cannot send money to it
●
Payable address: This is a fully plugged store where you can see and buy things (send Ether to it)
